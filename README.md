# Query ChEMBL

Here we use a google colab script to extract bioactivity data IC50 and EC50 for any protein target of interest   within the ChEMBL database. 


ChEMBL 34, released on 28/03/2024, includes a full update to drug and clinical candidate data. This version contains 2,431,025 compounds (with 2,409,270 having associated mol files), 3,106,257 compound records, 20,772,701 activity data points, 1,644,390 assays, 15,598 targets, and 89,892 documents.

## Brief Example Dataset & Project Description:
Diseases associated with RIPK1 gene mutations primarily involve disrupted regulation of cell death (necroptosis and apoptosis) and dysregulated inflammation. These can lead to a wide range of conditions, from autoimmune diseases to neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. We query the ChEMBL database to obtain information regarding bioactivity.
