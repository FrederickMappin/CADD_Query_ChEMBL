# Query ChEMBL

ChEMBL 34, released on 28/03/2024, includes a full update to drug and clinical candidate data. This version contains 2,431,025 compounds (with 2,409,270 having associated mol files), 3,106,257 compound records, 20,772,701 activity data points, 1,644,390 assays, 15,598 targets, and 89,892 documents.
Here we use a google colab script adapted from [dataprofessor](https://github.com/dataprofessor/code/blob/master/python/CDD_ML_Part_1_Bioactivity_Data_Concised.ipynb), to extract bioactivity data IC50 and EC50 for any protein target of within the ChEMBL database.
